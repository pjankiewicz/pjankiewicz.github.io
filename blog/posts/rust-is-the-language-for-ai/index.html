  <h1>Rust is the most important language at the moment</h1>
  <p class="post-meta">April 23, 2025</p>
  <h3 id="so-whats-the-gist">So, What's the Gist?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Honestly, it feels like Rust is popping up everywhere. Research points to it being a big deal because it's safe, fast, and big companies are actually using it.</li>
<li>My gut feeling? Rust's features just <em>work</em> well with AI coding assistants. It seems like it makes automating software development easier.</li>
<li>It's not just for one thing, either. You see it in web stuff, mobile, backend... frameworks like Dioxus and SpacetimeDB show it's got range.</li>
<li>Plus, when giants like AWS, Microsoft, and Google use it for important systems, you know it's got staying power.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quick-intro">Quick Intro</h3>
<p>Rust. You've probably heard of it. In 2025, it feels like it's really hit its stride – fast, safe, and surprisingly versatile. I wanted to jot down why I think it's so crucial right now, why it clicks for both people and AI, where you can use it, and who's betting on it. Just a quick rundown if you're curious.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-rust-even-matter">Why Does Rust Even Matter?</h3>
<p>Here's the thing: Rust manages to be super performant, like C or C++, but without constantly worrying about memory safety issues. No garbage collector needed, which is great for systems programming where things <em>have</em> to be reliable. You see it in developer surveys, like Stack Overflow's from this year – everyone wants to use it or keep using it <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/">Stack Overflow - What is Rust and why is it so popular?</a>. And it's not just talk; places like AWS and Google are building critical stuff with it. That tells you something <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/14/1067869/rust-worlds-fastest-growing-programming-language/">MIT Technology Review - How Rust went from a side project to the world's most-loved programming language</a>.</p>
<h3 id="why-devs-and-ai-seem-to-love-rust">Why Devs and AI Seem to Love Rust</h3>
<p>It's interesting – Rust's compiler can be strict, yeah, but its error messages? Super helpful. This turns out to be gold for AI coding assistants. It gives them clear feedback, making debugging and even generating code less of a shot in the dark. The strong type system and ownership model mean the AI is more likely to spit out code that actually works and is safe. Microsoft seems to be experimenting with this combo quite a bit <a href="https://medium.com/@Aaron0928/30-year-old-code-killed-microsoft-rewrites-windows-kernel-with-180-000-lines-of-rust-f891c95959f2">Medium - Rust at Microsoft</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rust-isnt-a-one-trick-pony">Rust Isn't a One-Trick Pony</h3>
<p>You can really use Rust for a lot. Web development, frontend, mobile apps, backend services, even dipping into machine learning. There are some cool frameworks making this happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dioxus</strong>: Build UIs for web, desktop, mobile – all from one Rust codebase. Pretty neat <a href="https://dioxuslabs.com/">Dioxus Official Website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>SpacetimeDB</strong>: This feels different – like a database and server smashed together, great for real-time stuff like games <a href="https://spacetimedb.com/docs">SpacetimeDB Official Website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Zino</strong>: A newer framework focused on putting things together easily, seems good for building backend apps <a href="https://github.com/zino-rs/zino">Zino Official Website</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whos-actually-using-it-the-big-players">Who's Actually Using It? The Big Players</h3>
<p>It's not just hobby projects. Big tech is seriously invested:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AWS</strong>: Uses it in Firecracker, the tech behind Lambda and Fargate.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Building parts of Azure IoT and even rewriting bits of Windows in Rust for better security.</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong>: Using it in Android and Chromium to cut down on bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Meta</strong>: Using it for backend services where performance counts.</li>
<li><strong>Dropbox</strong>: Rewrote their core sync engine in Rust.</li>
<li><strong>Cloudflare</strong>: Built their powerful Pingora proxy in Rust.</li>
<li><strong>And others</strong>: npm, Discord, Huawei, Atlassian... the list keeps growing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing this kind of adoption makes me think Rust isn't just a fad.</p>

<h3 id="digging-a-bit-deeper-rusts-rise-in-2025">Digging a Bit Deeper: Rust's Rise in 2025</h3>
<p>Alright, let's unpack this Rust thing a bit more. I've been looking into it (as of April 23, 2025), and here's a more detailed take on why it feels so important right now.</p>
<h4 id="why-rust-feels-significant">Why Rust Feels Significant</h4>
<p>Rust has carved out a niche by being fast <em>and</em> safe. You get performance close to C/C++, but the compiler helps prevent those nasty memory bugs (like dangling pointers or data races) <em>before</em> you even run the code. No garbage collector means predictable performance, which is crucial for systems-level stuff, cloud infrastructure, embedded devices – basically, anywhere reliability matters.</p>
<p>The buzz isn't just hype. GeeksforGeeks talks about its bright future <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/future-of-rust/">GeeksforGeeks - The Future of Rust in 2025</a>, and Stack Overflow surveys consistently show developers love it or really want to learn it <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/">Stack Overflow - What is Rust and why is it so popular?</a>. Why? It solves real problems, especially the memory management headaches common in older systems languages <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/14/1067869/rust-worlds-fastest-growing-programming-language/">MIT Technology Review - How Rust went from a side project to the world's most-loved programming language</a>.</p>
<p>Plus, the tooling (like Cargo for managing packages) and the community are pretty great. It feels like a language with momentum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_%28programming_language%29">Rust (programming language) - Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h4 id="the-connection-between-rust-developers-and-ai">The Connection Between Rust, Developers, and AI</h4>
<p>So, why does Rust seem to click with both human coders and AI assistants? For humans, it blends different programming styles nicely and has features like pattern matching that make code clean. But the real magic for AI might be the compiler.</p>
<p>Think about it: the compiler gives <em>specific</em>, detailed error messages. For an AI trying to write or fix code, that's invaluable input. It's much better than a vague crash. The strong type system and ownership rules also guide the AI toward generating safer, more correct code from the start. We're seeing this play out with tools like Microsoft's RustCoder <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/01/10/rustcoder-ai-assisted-rust-learning/">RustCoder: AI-assisted Rust learning | CNCF</a> and discussions online about using AI for Rust development <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1dl4pkk/ai_for_rust/">r/rust on Reddit: AI for Rust?</a>. It feels like Rust's design inherently makes it easier for AI to "understand" and work with <a href="https://medium.com/@Aaron0928/30-year-old-code-killed-microsoft-rewrites-windows-kernel-with-180-000-lines-of-rust-f891c95959f2">Medium - Rust at Microsoft</a>.</p>
<h4 id="rusts-flexibility-not-just-for-one-job">Rust's Flexibility: Not Just for One Job</h4>
<p>One of the coolest things about Rust is that you're not locked into one type of development. It's proving itself useful across the board:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web &amp; Cross-Platform Apps (Dioxus):</strong> Seriously, building UIs for web, desktop, <em>and</em> mobile with one Rust codebase? Dioxus is making that happen, and people seem impressed with its performance <a href="https://dioxuslabs.com/">Dioxus Official Website</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@sreevedvp/mastering-dioxus-a-powerful-rust-framework-for-cross-platform-development-b1d5a45d1a01">Mastering Dioxus: A Powerful Rust Framework for Cross-Platform Development | Medium</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time Systems (SpacetimeDB):</strong> This database is wild. It basically combines the database and server logic, letting clients run code <em>in</em> the database. Sounds perfect for multiplayer games or other real-time apps <a href="https://spacetimedb.com/docs">SpacetimeDB Official Website</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/15mgscr/spacetimedb_a_new_database_written_in_rust_that/?rdt=49409">Reddit - The heart of the internet</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Composable Backends (Zino):</strong> Zino aims to make building backend applications simpler and more flexible, with built-in tools for databases, tracing, etc. <a href="https://github.com/zino-rs/zino">Zino GitHub Repository</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxlinks.com/zino-next-generation-framework-for-composable-applications/">Zino - next-generation framework for composable applications - LinuxLinks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This flexibility means you can potentially stick with Rust for more parts of your stack, which is pretty appealing.</p>
<h4 id="codings-future-humans-ai-rust">Coding's Future: Humans + AI + Rust?</h4>
<p>Coding is changing fast. AI assistants are becoming standard tools, automating more and more. Rust seems uniquely positioned for this future. Its performance, safety, and concurrency are exactly what you need for reliable systems.</p>
<p>And its functional programming roots (enums, pattern matching, iterators – think Scala, but maybe more pragmatic) seem to mesh well with how AI might generate code. Some people are even speculating Rust could be central to future AI development itself <a href="https://datasciencetalent.co.uk/could-rust-be-the-future-of-ai-by-francesco-gadaleta/">Could Rust Be the Future of AI? By Francesco Gadaleta - Data Science Talent</a>, <a href="https://aarambhdevhub.medium.com/rust-for-ai-the-future-of-high-performance-machine-learning-56bc93dd1e74">Rust for AI: The Future of High-Performance Machine Learning | Medium</a>. It feels like Rust, AI, and maybe WebAssembly are converging to change how we build software <a href="https://content.red-badger.com/resources/how-ai-rust-and-webassembly-are-shaping-the-future-of-coding">How AI, Rust, and WebAssembly Are Shaping the Future of Coding - Red Badger</a>.</p>
<h4 id="functional-programmings-role">Functional Programming's Role</h4>
<p>It's worth noting Rust borrows heavily from functional programming (it was first written in OCaml!). Features like immutable data by default, powerful enums and pattern matching, and expressive iterators/closures make the code cleaner and often safer. This structure seems beneficial for AI tools trying to reason about and generate code <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-00-functional-features.html">Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures - The Rust Programming Language</a>, <a href="https://www.pragmaticcoders.com/resources/ai-developer-tools">Best AI for coding in 2025: software development, tool for programming | Pragmatic Coders</a>. It strikes a good balance – practical but with strong functional underpinnings.</p>
<h4 id="cool-rust-projects-worth-noting">Cool Rust Projects Worth Noting</h4>
<p>Just highlighting these again because they show what's possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dioxus:</strong> Write UIs once, run them anywhere (web, desktop, mobile) <a href="https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus">Dioxus GitHub Repository</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@sreevedvp/mastering-dioxus-a-powerful-rust-framework-for-cross-platform-development-b1d5a45d1a01">Mastering Dioxus | Medium</a>.</li>
<li><strong>SpacetimeDB:</strong> Database meets application server for real-time magic <a href="https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB">SpacetimeDB GitHub Repository</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/15mgscr/spacetimedb_a_new_database_written_in_rust_that/?rdt=49409">Reddit discussion</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Zino:</strong> A modern take on building backend applications with composability in mind <a href="https://github.com/zino-rs/zino">Zino GitHub Repository</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxlinks.com/zino-next-generation-framework-for-composable-applications/">LinuxLinks review</a>.</li>
</ul>
