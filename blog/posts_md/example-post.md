# Getting Started Here

Alright, so this is my first real go at putting something down in this blog format. It's pretty basic for now, mostly just figuring out how this Markdown stuff works again.

Just wanted to note a couple of things:

- Here's the first point.
- And the second one follows.

Also felt like dropping in a classic code snippet, you know the one:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Yeah, simple stuff, but you have to start somewhere, right? Feels a bit like that initial coding assistant work â€“ basic building blocks first. We'll see how it evolves.
